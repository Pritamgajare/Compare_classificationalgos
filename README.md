# Classification Algorithm Comparison

This repository contains code for the comparison of various classification algorithms. The algorithms included in this comparison are:

1. **Logistic Regression**
    - Implemented with libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
    - Implemented without libraries

2. **Naive Bayes Algorithm**
   
3. **K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**
   
4. **Decision Tree Algorithm**

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a dataset with the following steps:

- **Statistical and Categorical Summary:** Explore the dataset with statistical measures and categorical summaries to gain insights into the data.

- **Data Filtration:** Remove any irrelevant or redundant features and handle missing values if necessary.

- **Data Distribution:** Understand the distribution of the data, visualize it, and make necessary transformations.

## Implementation

Each classification algorithm is implemented separately with detailed comments and explanations. The goal is to showcase how these algorithms can be implemented both with and without external libraries.

Happy coding!
